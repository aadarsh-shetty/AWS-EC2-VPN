# AWS EC2 VPN

Set up a VPN server on an AWS EC2 Instance via a single, self contained, Cloud Formation template.

See [aws-ec2-vpn.json](https://github.com/weavenet/aws-ec2-vpn/blob/master/aws-ec2-vpn.json) for raw template.

## Setup via AWS Console

Follow the [AWS Cloud Formation Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html)
to create a new Cloud Formation Stack from the [aws-ec2-vpn.json](https://github.com/weavenet/aws-ec2-vpn/blob/master/aws-ec2-vpn.json) template.

## Setup via CLI

You must have the [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and available in your path.

Additionally, you must set your default AWS credentials to a user with permissions to setup a VPC and launch EC2 instances.

Clone down this repo and execute the **setup.sh** script with the following input.

```shell
$ bash setup.sh YOUR_VPN_PRE_SHARED_KEY YOUR_VPN_USERNAME YOUR_VPN_PASSWORD
```

Once the setup is complete, the script will return the persistent EIP of the Instance. For example:

```shell
$ bash setup.sh MySuperSecretPreSharedKey vpnuser TheVPNUserPassword
VPN Setup in progress.
VPN Setup complete. IP address is '35.164.187.145'.
```

## Costs

The only charge will be for the EC2 instance hours, currently set to t2.nano, and network bandwidth.

At the time of this writing the instance hours cost under $5.00 USD per month in us-west-2 if the VPN is ran continuously.

See [AWS On Demand Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) for current pricing.
